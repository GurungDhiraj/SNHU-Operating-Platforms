# SNHU CS230: Operating-Platforms
<ins>**Course Description:**<ins>

Students will develop a deeper understanding of operating platforms and architectures through the analysis and evaluation of the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each. Students will learn the value of utilizing software design templates as well as how to utilize them to solve problems.

<ins>**Course Competencies:**<ins>

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

CS-30406: Utilize software design templates and patterns to efficiently solve a problem

CS-30407: Analyze the characteristics of and techniques specific to various systems architectures

CS-30408: Evaluate the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of various platforms

<ins>**Questions:**<ins>

Q: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

A: The client, The Gaming Room, is currently working on expanding an Android-based game application called Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room wants to reach a broader audience by making the game application available on multiple platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Q: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

A: My instructor mentioned that the design and logic of my Java code were implemented well and met the functional requirements. I was also able to identify a good set of software design features and provided good reasoning for my recommendations to The Gaming Room. 

Q: What about the process of working through a design document? Did you find it helpful when developing the code?

A: The outline and layout of the design document helped me stay on task. I could focus on specific parts of the document at any given time and look forward and see how each part of the document relates to the other. The structure of the document was also helpful in helping me research the specific topics I needed for different parts of the project

Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

A: One part of the document that I want to revise is the Design Constraints section and I would try to write more concisely. I want the writing to be shorter and more direct.

Q: Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? 

A: It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because it is the user who will ultimately be using the gaming application, and designing the software to be more user-friendly will help improve their perception of the game. Additionally, creating a user-friendly game can also lead to more players playing the game. I interpreted the user’s needs as something to make the user’s life easier and give them a smoother gaming experience. I chose the Windows OS due to its user-friendly nature and recommended the use of encryption to secure the User’s data.

Q: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

A: I approached designing the software in parts. I worked on each part of the document separately and made sure to do a lot of research for each section before writing in each section. In the future, I will have a base-level knowledge of analyzing and designing software applications, so I will know more about where to look for resources when doing research. I will also continue to approach the design document in parts so that I don’t overwhelm myself by trying to design the whole thing at once.
